**Security Notes**

Authentication:
  * Definiton:
      The process by which an individual or system's identiy is verified. Authentication establishes WHO a user is but does not establish permissions or access rights. Methods of authentication include
          * Username/Password
          * Biometrics
          * Multi-factor
          * Tokens

  * Risk Assesment:

Authorization:
  * Definiton:
      The authorizaiton step compares the access levels of the asset to the permissions of the 
      user and grants or denys access accordingly. Even authenticated users can be denied 
      authorization if their user permissions are beneath that of the asset.

  * Risk Assesment:

Access:
  * Definition:
      Granting the user access to an asset. This is determined by both the authentication and 
      authorization steps. There are different methodologies for determineing access. They include
      but are not limited to:
        * Access Control Lists (ACLs)
        * Role-based Access Control (RBAC)
        * Mandatory Access Control (MAC)

  * Risk Assesment:
  




Research on how to write a Risk statement.

i.e. Given the <Condition> there is a possibility that <EVENT> may occur, causing <CONSEQUENCES>.

Write a security risk statement for each of the As

Part 2: Create Software Development Folder Links to an external site.
As you start to implement features, you need to provide artifacts on your changes to they can be reviewed.

Each story will have an associated directory. In that directory it will have:

Task Description Document
  This contains the story
  What requirements the story satisfies
  What design elements are related
Difference Listing
Unit Test Cases
Review Report
  Documents are updated
  Code is checked in
  Unit Tests are run


Provide a link to each of your Storyâ€™s Software Development folder
