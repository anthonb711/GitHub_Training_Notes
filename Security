**Security Notes**

-Authentication:
  * Definiton:
      The process by which an individual or system's identiy is verified. Authentication 
      establishes WHO a user is but does not establish permissions or access rights. Methods of authentication include
          * Username/Password
          * Biometrics
          * Multi-factor
          * Tokens

  * Risk Statement:
      Given that the UL Panel App requires users to log in, there is a possibility
      is a possibility of an injection attack, causing an unauthenticated user to be authenticated.
       

      Likelihood: High

      Impact: High


-Authorization:
  * Definiton:
      The authorizaiton step compares the access levels of the asset to the permissions of the 
      user and grants or denys access accordingly. Even authenticated users can be denied 
      authorization if their user permissions are beneath that of the asset.

  * Risk Statement:
      Given that the there is intellectual property stored on the servers, there is a possibility
      of user permissions to be set incorrectly, causing unauthorized access to customer IP.

      Likelihood: High

      Impact: High


-Access:
  * Definition:
      Granting the user access to an asset. This is determined by both the authentication and 
      authorization steps. There are different methodologies for determineing access. They include
      but are not limited to:
        * Access Control Lists (ACLs)
        * Role-based Access Control (RBAC)
        * Mandatory Access Control (MAC)

  * Risk Statement:
      Given that the there will be an access control systes there is a possibility
      of user asset or user permission levels to be set improperly causing unauthorized access to
      customer IP. This could lead to the loss of or comprimised IP.

      Likelihood: High

      Impact: High
