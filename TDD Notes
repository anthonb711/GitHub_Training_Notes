****Test Drive Development Training Notes****
-----------------------------------------------------------------

What advantages as a developer does TDD provide?
  
   * Improved Code Quality: 
        Writing tests first forces you to think about the design and structure of your code, which can lead to more robust, maintainable,           and better-organized code.
   * Easier Debugging:
        If a test fails, it is easier to identify the source of the problem and debug the code.
   * Faster Development:
        TDD encourages a more incremental and iterative approach to development, which can lead to faster progress.
   * Better Documentation:
        Test cases serve as a form of documentation for the code, making it easier for other developers to understand the functionality and         requirements of the code.
   * Confidence in Refactoring:
        With a suite of tests in place, you can refactor your code with confidence, knowing that if a test fails, you can quickly identify
        the problem.

What steps do I do to implement TDD?
   
   * Write a test:
        Write a test case that tests a single aspect of the functionality you want to implement.
   * Run the test:
        Run the test and see that it fails, as the functionality has not yet been implemented.
   * Write the code:
        Write just enough code to make the test pass.
   * Refactor the code:
        Refactor the code as necessary, making sure that all tests still pass.
   * Repeat the process:
        Repeat the process for each new aspect of functionality you want to implement.

What tools or software can I use to do unit testing?
    
    The tools and software for unit testing, depends on the programming language and framework you are using. Some popular unit testing         frameworks include:
        * JUnit for Java
        * NUnit for .NET
        * pytest for Python
        * RSpec for Ruby
        * Mocha for JavaScript
        * PHPUnit for PHP
        * CppUnit for C++
