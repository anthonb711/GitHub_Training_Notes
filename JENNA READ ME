So there might be an offer from Graham Packaking in the ball park of $100K possibly a signing bonus to do machine assembly work.
I dont want GEC to catch wind of the opportunity so I dont want to use my phone with all the spyware on to discuss it. 
We can talk more about it in person when I get home.
